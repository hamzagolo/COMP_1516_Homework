#hello mneoh thank you for your thank you for sharing the codes it has been a helpfull tool. i am reaching out to know if you might have the code for the final exam 
#the practical or the theory one i would really appreciate. this is my instagram # wildb_east1 
#might be a funny wasy to connect but ignore merging this .
# a
first_name = input("Enter your first name:")
print("Hello, "+first_name)

# b
x, y = 5, 10
total = x + y
print(x, "+", y, "=", total)

# c
a = 10.5
b = 4.0
product = a * b
print(a, "*", b, "=", product)

# d
print(int(product) - total)
# If "product" is not converted to an int
# the output for the print statement will be of type float

# e
print("The program is done.", end="")    # end is used to make sure there isn't a new line
